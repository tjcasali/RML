                    The team over at <a href="https://keeptradecut.com/">KeepTradeCut.com</a> has an incredible system to determine player trade values based on crowdsourced data.
                    Here at DynastyRanker you can rank the teams in your league based on the trade values and find a trade proposal that can help improve all of the teams involved.

                <p>
                    Sometimes it can seem impossible to send trades that will get accepted even if the value lines up, hopefully we can help.
                    Click to view your team's trade candidates and send trades that will improve the other owner's team as well as yours.
